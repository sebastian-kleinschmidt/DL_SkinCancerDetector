# Deep Learning: Image based Skin Cancer Detector (EXPERIMENTAL, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND)
A deep learning algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis). The training, validation and test data are pulled from the [2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a).
